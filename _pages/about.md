My name is Nishanth Balamohan, I currently work as a Software Engineer at Thoughtworks Canada. I have been interested in science and technology from a young age, I believe this passion began when I saw a simulation of the Spirit and Opportunity Mars landings. This love for technology is continued through my work and even my hobbies.
