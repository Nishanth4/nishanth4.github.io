Hello there, I'm Nishanth Balamohan, I currently work as a Software Engineer at Thoughtworks Canada. My journey into the world of science and technology began at a young age. This passion began when I saw a simulation of the Spirit and Opportunity Mars landings. This fascination for science and technology has become a part of my professional life and personal interests. 

One of my greatest passions is space technology. I love following the various space programs that are going on. Of course my favourite program is still Opportunity (RIP Oppy), but I also love Voyager I and II, ISS, Hubble, JWST, and more. Another one of my passions is Formula 1. To me, it's the marriage of sport, engineering and technology. It's the perfect blend of my interests.   

When it comes to software engineering I don't have a specific topic that I enjoy over the other. I love learning about best practices in OOP, and I've recently been more intrigued by microservices and how to best implement and optimize them. I just always love learning about new things. If I stumble upon something that I find interesting, or a topic that is underrepresented, I will make a point to write about it. I invite you to join me in my journey. Your feedback, questions, or constructive criticism are not only welcomed but encouraged. Please reach out to me via email at: <nishanthbalamohan4@gmail.com>
